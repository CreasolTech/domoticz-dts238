# domoticz-dts238 

DTS238 ZN/S is a Class 1 (1% accuracy) power and energy meter for three-phase 400V 100A max, with Modbus RTU bus and additional pulsed output.

This is a plugin for the free open-source [Domoticz home automation system](https://www.domoticz.com) that **read one or more DTS238 ZN/S three-phase energy meters by Modbus connection** (RS485 serial connection), providing the following data: 
* total active energy (imported + exported energy)
* import active energy and power
* export active energy and power
* net active energy and power (imported - exported energy)
* active, reactive and apparent power
* voltage on each phase
* current on each phase
* frequency
* power factor, total and per phase

It's possible to configure:
* Bitrate, by default 9600 bps
* Meter address, for example 1 (only one meter with default slave address) or 11,12 (two devices with address 11 and 12: address should be separated by comma)
* Poll interval, in seconds: in case of a long list of devices, don't use very short poll intervals!

Please note that it's possible to easily connect many DTS238 ZN/S meters to the same RS485 bus, by using a common shielded cable within 2 wires (A and B terminal blocks) to a cheap RS485/USB adaper/converter.

Also, it's possible to connect different devices to the same Modbus, managed by different plugins (for example DTS238 + DDS238 meters, PZEM meters, ...): plugin automatically detect access collision and set the new poll interval in a random way to limit collisions.

## Setting a different address for the meter

By default, DTS238 ZN/S meters have slave address=1: when a meter with default address is connected to the RS485 bus, only a device will be created just to permit changing its address. Telemetry from default address meter will not be read!

To change the meter address of a new meter with default address=1, select the *Change Address 1 -> 2-247* virtual device, edit the Description field writing **ADDR=2**  to change the meter address to 2. Address valid range is between 2 and 247.

In case you want to change the address of a meter that already has an address between 2 and 247, select the corresponding *Power Factor* device, edit the Description field writing ADDR=3  to change the meter address to 3. Address valid range is between 2 and 247.

Then, go to Setup -> Hardware -> DTS238 Plugin and add that address to the end of *Meter addresses* list. **NEVER CHANGE THE *Meter addresses* SEQUENCE** adding new devices in the middle, or you'll mix/loose previous telemetry!!


# Installation

This plugin can be installed from [Python Plugin Manager](https://github.com/ycahome/pp-manager) or [Python Plugins Manager](https://github.com/stas-demydiuk/domoticz-plugins-manager) which also permit to update plugin easily or automatically.

Alternatively, it's possible to give the following commands from the linux shell:

```
cd ~/domoticz/plugins
git clone https://github.com/CreasolTech/domoticz-dts238
```

Then, in the future, to update the plugin it's possible to simply type
```
cd ~/domoticz/plugins/domoticz-dts238
git pull
```

It uses the python plugin module minimalmodbus , than can be installed by
```
sudo apt install pyserial
sudo pip3 install minimalmodbus
```


Restart Domoticz, then go to Setup -> Hardware and add the DTS238 plugin, specifying a name for that hardware and the serial port.

## Creasol DomBus modules

Below a list of modules, produced in Europe by Creasol, designed for Domoticz to be reliable and optimized for very very low power consumption.

Our industrial and home automation modules are designed to be
* very low power (**around 10mW with relays OFF**)
* reliable (**no disconnections**)
* bus connected (**no radiofrequency interference, no battery to replace**).

Modules are available in two version:
1. with **DomBus proprietary protocol**, working with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) only
2. with **Modbus standard protocol**, working with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org)

### DomBusEVSE - EVSE module to build a Smart Wallbox / EV charging station
<a href="https://store.creasol.it/DomBusEVSE"><img src="https://images.creasol.it/creDomBusEVSE_plug_300.webp" alt="DomBusEVSE smart EVSE module to make a Smart Wallbox EV Charging station" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" align="left" /></a>
Complete solution to make a Smart EVSE, **charging the electric vehicle using only energy from renewable source (photovoltaic, wind, ...), or adding 25-50-75-100% of available power from the grid**.

* **Single-phase and three-phase**, up to 32A (8kW or 22kW)
* Needs external contactor, RCCB (protection) and EV cable
* Optional power meter to measure charging power, energy, voltage and power factor
* Optional power meter to measure the power usage from the grid (not needed if already exists)
* **Two max grid power thresholds** can be programmed: for example, in Italy who have 6kW contractual power can drain from the grid Max (6* 1.27)=7.6kW for max 90 minutes followed by (6* 1.1)=6.6kW for another 90 minutes: in this case **the EVSE module can drain ALL available power** when programmed to charge at 100% **minimizing the charge time and increasing the charging efficiency**.
* **Works without the domotic controller** (stand-alone mode), and **can also work in *managed mode*, with an automation in the home automation system setting the charging current**
